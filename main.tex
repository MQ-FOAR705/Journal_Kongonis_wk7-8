\subsection{Lesson 2: Working With Open Refine}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Exercises}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{2/10/19 14:32 Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Facets 1'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} There is definately a lot of errors in this. The Chirdozo with one entry is probably an error, same with Ruca. This is also the same for the Ruaca-Nhamuenda. Finally, the number 49 is clearly an error that cant be solved at this stage. I would diagnose the incorrect one as the entry that has the lowest frquency.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Facets 2'}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} There are 19 inputs. It appears as if it has been formatted by text. After using the transform function to format them as dates, it would appear that the majority of interviews were done in 2016.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 1'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:}Implemented the codes to remove the commas and brackets as instructed. Was a success although initially i missed some quotation marks and there was an error.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 2'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented facet, mobile phone and radio were both at 86 and the lowest 2 were car at 3 and computer at 2.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 3'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented each code separately, ended up with a lot of results grouped together. It showed that November had the highest frequency but it was combined with October.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 4'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented cleaning code to the cells suggested and received no error messages.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Undo and Redo'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:}Went into the undo redo section and individually went though each step as instructed. It seems like a really useful way to see mistakes.}
