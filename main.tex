\subsection{Lesson 2: Working With Open Refine}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Exercises}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{2/10/19 14:32 Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Facets 1'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} There is definately a lot of errors in this. The Chirdozo with one entry is probably an error, same with Ruca. This is also the same for the Ruaca-Nhamuenda. Finally, the number 49 is clearly an error that cant be solved at this stage. I would diagnose the incorrect one as the entry that has the lowest frquency.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Facets 2'}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} There are 19 inputs. It appears as if it has been formatted by text. After using the transform function to format them as dates, it would appear that the majority of interviews were done in 2016.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 1'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:}Implemented the codes to remove the commas and brackets as instructed. Was a success although initially i missed some quotation marks and there was an error.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 2'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented facet, mobile phone and radio were both at 86 and the lowest 2 were car at 3 and computer at 2.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 3'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented each code separately, ended up with a lot of results grouped together. It showed that November had the highest frequency but it was combined with October.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Transforming Data 4'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented cleaning code to the cells suggested and received no error messages.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Undo and Redo'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:}Went into the undo redo section and individually went though each step as instructed. It seems like a really useful way to see mistakes.}

\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Lesson 3: Filtering and Sorting with Open Refine}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Exercises}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Filtering'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Completed the instructions. In the facet it just showed the inputs that included mabat.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Excluding Entries'}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} By using the include and exclude functions, i am able to only showcase entries i want to see.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Sort'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Implemented the sort code as instructed and shown in class. As discussed, the 0 result would be a mistake.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Sorting by Multiple Columns'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} When we compare the gps coordinates of 49, we can see that its clustered with chodrizo village. Therefore we can infer that it is also chodrizo.}



\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Lesson 4: Examining Numbers in Open Refine}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Exercises}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Numbers'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Changed the suggested cells to numbers and it worked. Did it for village and it changed the 49 to a green number as i forgot to change it to chodrizo.}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Numeric Facet'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:}Changed the top cell in no members to abc then did the numerical facet and got a non numerical input.}



\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Lesson 5: Using Scripts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{textbf{Exercise: Saving Work as Script.}}
    
    \subitem{\textbf{Result:} Work successfully saved as .Json script.}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Lesson 6: Exporting and Saving Data from Open Refine}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Exercises}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Saving and Exporting a Project'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Exported the .tar file, unpacked it and saw a history folder full of changes. There was also a data compressed file. Then i exported a csv file.}


\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Lesson 7: Other Resources in Open Refine}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Exercises}}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{Intention:} Complete Exercise 'Using Online Resources to get Help with Open Refine'.}
\subitem{\textbf{Result:} Went on sites and had a look.}


\end{enumerate}
